1) Upload to imgbb
2) Navigate to imgbb site for that painting
3) Right click image of painting and click "Copy Image Address"
4) Copy and paste a painting object in marcia.js
    i.e.:
    {
      "name": "Square One II",
      "img": "https://image.ibb.co/f8yYpo/square_One_II.jpg" ,
      "year": "2018",
      "medium": "Acrylic paint on canvas",
      "size": "40 x 40 inches"
    },
    note: - commas are necessary between each line/item, including the trailing comma
          - Make sure the new painting is in the correct catagory (i.e. "colorWeave")

5) Fill in values with correct info for the new painting
    note: - Be sure to use the correct image url. It should look like the example above.
6) Double click "upload-checker" and verify correctness
 -  As outputted in the terminal, you should navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your browser
6) Double click "upload-helper"
 - Answering "y" will upload to the web server. Whatever you upload will be your website.
 - Answering "n" to the prompt will delete your changes to marcia.js and go back to last working version. If you mess up, you can always just run upload-helper, press "n" to remove the bad changes, run upload-helper again, and answer "y" to restore the previous website.
