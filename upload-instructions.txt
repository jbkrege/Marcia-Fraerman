1) Upload image of new painting to imgbb.com
2) Navigate to imgbb site for that painting
3) Right click image of painting and click "Copy Image Address"
4) Click on Finder application in the bottom tool bar. Go to Documents -> Website -> Marcia-Fraerman -> Website -> js. Double click marcia.js. This will open Sublime, which is a text editor. Copy ( cmd + c ) and paste ( cmd + v ) a painting object in marcia.js. A painting object is enclosed by braces like these: { painting_object } 
    i.e.:
    {
      "name": "Square One II",
      "img": "https://image.ibb.co/f8yYpo/square_One_II.jpg" ,
      "year": "2018",
      "medium": "Acrylic paint on canvas",
      "size": "40 x 40 inches"
    },
    note: - commas are necessary between each line/item, including the trailing comma
          - Make sure the new painting is in the correct catagory (i.e. "colorWeave")

5) Fill in values with correct info for the new painting
    note: - Be sure to use the correct image url. It should look like the example above.
6) Back in Finder, double click "upload-checker" and verify correctness
 -  As outputted in the terminal, you should navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your browser
 -  After checking, feel free to exit out of the terminal window (the white box with a bunch of arcane text)
7) Double click "upload-helper"
 - Answering "y" will upload to the web server. Whatever you upload will be your website.
 - Answering "n" to the prompt will delete your changes to marcia.js and go back to last working version. If you mess up, you can always just run upload-helper, press "n" to remove the bad changes, run upload-helper again, and answer "y" to restore the previous website.
